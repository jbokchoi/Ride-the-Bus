# Ride the Bus

Ride the Bus is a take on a classic high-low drinking card game where the player has to correctly guess whether the next card in the deck to be flipped is higher or lower than the previous one.

The 'bus' represents the card deck - one with 52 stops. Once the player is on the 'bus', they have two ways to get 'off':

1. Correctly guess high or low 7 times in a row, or 
2. Ride the entire 'bus-route' of cards (52 cards)

Every time the player makes an inncorrect guess, they are penalized with a drink and their winning streak is reset.
